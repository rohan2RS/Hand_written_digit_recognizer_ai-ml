# Hand_written_digit_recognizer_ai-ml
This project demonstrates how to build a handwritten digit recognition system using TensorFlow. We used the MNIST dataset, which contains images of handwritten digits. The key steps involved were:

Loading and preparing the data: We loaded the MNIST dataset and preprocessed the images by normalizing and reshaping them.
Building a neural network model: We created a Sequential model with Dense layers to learn patterns in the image data.
Training the model: We trained the model on the prepared data to recognize the digits.
Evaluating and predicting: We evaluated the model's performance and used it to predict the digit in a new image.
Saving the model: Finally, we saved the trained model for future use.
In essence, we built a model that can take an image of a handwritten digit and tell us which digit it is.
